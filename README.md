# Fast-Fourier-Transform-CT-
Attached is the original Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm.  Both FFT and IFFT programs assume the inputs have a power of 2 elements
so in the main function expect to perform some zero padding to achieve this.   THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE EFFICIENT AND OUTLINE THE ORIGINAL Cooley-Tukey FFT PROCESS.

Both FFT and IFFT work as intended and the original derivations are included in my final seminar report attached along with some neat digital signal processing applications.  (Recommended to use Hamming window to split up initial audio signal segments as outlined in report for maximum noise removal)
